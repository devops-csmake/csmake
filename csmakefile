description=build scripting tool allowing a completely specified build process
about=Most build tools are centered around the idea of delivering one or a
 handful of results based around a single tool or development path.
 Many of the steps required to achieve the desired results in these
 environments are hard-coded or done intrinsically.
 .
 While many of these tools claim to be general-purpose (any tool can be made
 to work for your job.  Sure, you can hammer in a nail with a screwdriver),
 they tend to become cumbersome to use and source files difficult to
 maintain.  make and scons build C/C++ files, maven and ant build Java, for
 example.  All of these tools have been used, and even successfully used,
 for projects outside of the scope of their sweet spots.  However, what the
 developer will often find is, the farther away one gets from the intended
 purpose of these tools, the more difficult the job of using the tool becomes
 and the more difficult it becomes, in some cases, to predict what the tool
 will actually do - as the complexity of the required build specification
 grows, so does the ability to grasp what will actually happen.  Worse,
 in some cases, you end up doing more work and the results end up more opaque
 than if you had simply wrote a shell script or small utility program to do
 the job of codifying the build process.  This is where csmake departs from
 the standard software build tools.
 .
 For csmake, the goal is simply to provide a way to catalog and instantiate
 python classes that will execute the requirements of the build tasks at hand.
 Thus, csmake provides a build development framework where developers can
 draw from standard and custom building blocks in python to accomplish
 and complete building software projects with a completely specified
 make (csmake).
 .
 Python coverage is needed if you want to use the python testing
